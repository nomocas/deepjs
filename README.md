> deepjs is a tools set for managing standard javascripts functions, objects and promises.

Based on Layered and/or Chained Programmation approach, it provides, uses and mixes : 

* Layered Aspect Oriented Programmation
* Query Based Programmation including Code Sheet
* Object Capabilities Management (or Model)
* full Promised asynch management
* homogeneous HTTP Rest compliant ressources management
* Modularisation by Protocole approach

It works both server side and browser side. Its aim is to be totaly unobstrusive, ergonomic as possible and usable with any other js lib/framework.

As jquery (that is highly unobstrusive and ergonomic) works on standard DOM objects, deepjs works on standard js objects and functions structures.
